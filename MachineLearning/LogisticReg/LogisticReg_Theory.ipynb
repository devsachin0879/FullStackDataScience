    "## Introduction\n",
    "In linear regression, the type of data we deal with is quantitative, whereas we use classification models to deal with qualitative data or categorical data. The algorithms used for solving a classification problem first predict the probability of each of the categories of the qualitative variables, as the basis for making the classification. And, as the probabilities are continuous numbers, classification using probabilities also behave like regression methods. \n",
    "Logistic regression is one such type of classification model which is used to classify the dependent variable into two or more classes or categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Why don’t we use Linear regression for classification problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s suppose you took a survey and noted the response of each person as satisfied, neutral or Not satisfied.\n",
    "Let’s map each category:\n",
    "\n",
    "Satisfied – 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutral – 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Not Satisfied – 0\n",
    "\n",
    "But this doesn’t mean that the gap between Not satisfied and Neutral is same as Neutral and satisfied. There is no mathematical significance of these mapping. We can also map the categories like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Satisfied – 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutral – 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Not Satisfied – 2\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s completely fine to choose the above mapping. If we apply linear regression to both the type of mappings, we will get different sets of predictions. Also, we can get prediction values like 1.2, 0.8, 2.3 etc. which makes no sense for categorical values. So, there is no normal method to convert qualitative data into quantitative data for use in linear regression.\n",
    "Although, for binary classification, i.e. when there only two categorical values, using the least square method can give decent results. Suppose we have two categories Black and White and we map them as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Black – 0\n",
    "\n",
    "White - 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "We can assign predicted values for both the categories such as Y> 0.5 goes to class white and vice versa.\n",
    "Although, there will be some predictions for which the value can be greater than 1 or less than 0 making them hard to classify in any class. Nevertheless, linear regression can work decently for binary classification but not that well for multi-class classification. \n",
    "Hence, we use classification methods for dealing with such problems.\n"

    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is one such regression algorithm which can be used for performing classification problems. It calculates the probability that a given value belongs to a specific class. If the probability is more than 50%, it assigns the value in that particular class else if the probability is less than 50%, the value is assigned to the other class. Therefore, we can say that logistic regression acts as a binary classifier.\n",

    "###### Working of a Logistic Model\n",
    "For linear regression, the model is defined by:\n",
    "$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x  $       - (i)\n",

    "But, when we use equation(i) to calculate probability, we would get values less than 0 as well as greater than 1. That doesn’t make any sense\n",
